# Iridium
Minecraft Bedrock Edition add-on that adds iridium.

## Includes
### Blocks
Iridium Ore (randomly generated below y=12)

Block of Iridium

### Items
Iridium ingots (obtained via smelting Iridium Ore)

### Tools
Notes:
- Tools mine instantly
- Tools have infinite durability
- Tools cannot be enchanted

Iridium Axe

Iridium Hoe

Iridium Pickaxe

Iridium Shovel

Iridium Sword

### Structures
Meteor Crater (Contains Iridium Ore and Iron Ore)

## Note
To use this addon, you will need to enable experimental gameplay in world settings.

## Problems
1. Tools do not support all blocks yet (eg. pickaxe cannot break Block of Diamond)
2. Tools do not take damage when used

## Future Improvements
1. Once enchanting is supported, add enchantments and remove instant mining
2. Add armour items when support is released (seen in 1.16.100 beta)
3. Add custom mobs (mooglooms?) that hang out at crater sites
4. Add random debris surrounding craters
